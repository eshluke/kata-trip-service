# kata-trip-service
Legacy code refactoring & testing kata adapted from https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata

## Description
- We want to refactor the class `TripService`.
- We *cannot* change existing code if not convered by tests.
  - Exception: Automated refactorings via IDE are allowed without tests. 
- In the class `TripServiceTest`, test the `TripService` only (*not* its collaborators).

## Branches
- `master`: start kata from here
- `solution`: my solution
